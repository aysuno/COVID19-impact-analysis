# The Impact of COVID-19 in Open Source Software Development

Software developers have been affected by COVID-19 pandemic. Before the pandemic a 
lot of developers have been working physically however, due to the COVID-19, developers had
to change their working conditions from physical to virtual. This rapid change may also affect the 
commit numbers of the developers if we compare before and after pandemic. In this paper we try 
to analyze commit numbers of the developers during COVID-19 pandemic. We use GitHub to 
clone a python project and after that analyze this projectâ€™s commit history and visualize the data 
that we get. We also observe COVID-19 cases graphs and commit numbers of graphs to show 
correlation between these two. We found that there is no considerable change in commit numbers 
before and during pandemic. However, we believe that with more detailed observation and using 
more projects the result that we found may change. Our findings can be used to see what the 
correlation between COVID-19 and number is of commits in open-source projects.

Please see the report for the detailed information and findings.
